# Arc-Music-Player
A simple music player

The Arc Music Player is path-based rather than library-based music player. Save your music library in a file that just contains the paths to the sound files without actually having to copy those files to a separate directory.

Arc Music Player includes just the most basic playback commands:
- Loading a number of songs into a list that will be played
- Picking any song from that list
- Skipping to next/going back to previous song
- Pausing and resuming
- Moving to a different point in the song
- Jumping forwards/backwards 10 or 30 seconds
- Volume control (separate from system volume)
- Saving/loading/clearing song list
- Shuffle
- Repeat on song or whole list
